how to disable test cases in xml file
 because while running from xml file if i write in test page  enable=true still running all the test cases 

how to handle pull-request   if there're frequent  modification in framework 
lets say my code already reviewed and approved but there some modification in xml file or report can i directly push origin master or it has to 
review again after each modification


i don't know  how correct is my question but i want to ask 
lets say i have 20 test cases if I'm executing them from testng.xml file separately they work perfectly fine but in blue ocean pipeline some 
error occurs 
how to handle this ?
